## Context & Data

The FLAIR #1 dataset is sampled countrywide and is composed of over 20 billion annotated pixels, acquired over three years and different months (spatio-temporal domains). The dataset is available to download <a href="https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/">here.</a> It consists of 512 x 512 patches with 13 (baselines) or 19 (full) semantic classes (see associated datapaper). Each patch has 5 channels (RVB-Infrared-Elevation).

## Baseline model 

A U-Net architecture with a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder from the pytorch segmentation models library is used for the baselines. The used architecture allows integration of patch-wise metadata information and employs commonly used image data augmentation techniques. It has about 24.4M parameters and it is implemented using the _segmentation-models-pytorch_ library. The results are evaluated with an Intersection Over Union (IoU) metric and a single mIoU is reported (see associated datapaper).

The _metadata_ strategy refers encoding metadata with a shallow MLP and concatenate this encoded information to the U-Net encoder output. The _augmentation_ strategy employs three typical geometrical augmentations (see associated datapaper).


Example of a semantic segmentation of an urban and coastal area in the D076 spatial
domain, obtained with the baseline trained model:

## Usage 

The `flair-1-config.yml` file controls paths, hyperparameters and computing ressources. The file `requirement.txt` is listing used libraries for the baselines.

To launch a training/inference/metrics computation, you can either use : 

- ```
  main.py --config_file=flair-1-config.yml
  ```

-  use the `flair-1-baseline.ipynb` notebook guiding you through data visualization, training and testing steps.

A toy dataset (reduced size) is available to check that your installation and the information in the configuration file are correct.
